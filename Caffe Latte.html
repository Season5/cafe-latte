           Caffe Latte
A caffe latte is a single shot of espresso to three parts of steamed milk.

How to have it: Sugar your latte to taste and discover the wonderful world of dipping. Cookies, sponge-type cake slices and even fresh Italian bread can transform your coffee into a breakfast that even my nonna (grandmother) would approve of.

Give it a twist: Not commonly taken with a twist.
