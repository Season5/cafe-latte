    <h2>CAPPUCCINO</h2>
        <img src="cappuccino.jpg">
    <P> This hugely popular coffee drink has become a staple that even the most common of corner coffee shops carries (or at least a version of it). A true cappuccino is a combination of equal parts espresso, steamed milk and milk froth. This luxurious drink, if made properly, can double as a dessert with its complex flavors and richness.

How to have it: It is common to sprinkle your cappuccino froth with a bit of unsweetened cocoa powder or grated dark chocolate.

Give it a twist: Asking for your cap "scuro" (dark) means you want less milk than usual, while "chiaro" (light) means you want more. Iced cappuccino makes a great summer drink, and a "skinny" cappuccino is made with skim or nonfat milk.
